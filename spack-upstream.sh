Usage: $0 [options]

This script clones a new local Spack installation (named 'spack') and configures
it to use an upstream Spack installation. It attempts to match the upstream Spack
version and optionally handles the spack-packages repository (for Spack 1.0+).

Options:
  -u, --upstream <path>      Path to the upstream Spack installation. Defaults to
                             SPACK_ROOT if a Spack environment is loaded.
  -l, --local <path>         Path where the new 'spack' directory will be created.
                             Defaults to current directory. Script will error if
                             'spack' already exists at this location.
  -n, --name <name>          Name for the new Spack directory. Defaults to 'spack'.
  -d, --develop              Use develop version of spack (do not match upstream
                             version).
  --full-history             Clone with full git history instead of shallow clone.
                             Slower but useful for development.
  -p, --packages <option>    How to handle spack-packages repo (for Spack 1.0+):
                               'upstream' - use upstream's packages repo
                               'new' - clone a new local packages repo matching version
                               'none' - don't configure packages repo (default)
  -h, --help                 Display this help message.

Notes:
  - To set an upstream for an *existing* local Spack, use the following
    command after initializing your Spack install:
      spack config --scope site add "upstreams:e4s:install_tree:\$UPSTREAM_SPACK_ROOT/opt/spack"
  - This script will checkout the spack version matching the upstream spack if possible
  - For Spack 1.0+, packages are in a separate repository (spack-packages)
  - Configuration settings (concretizer:reuse, concretizer:unify, mirrors) are
    automatically copied from upstream using spack config blame
  - The script will fail if a 'spack' directory already exists at the target location

Examples:

- Create downstream Spack in current directory from loaded upstream:
  $0

- Specify upstream Spack and destination directory:
  $0 -u /path/to/upstream/spack -l /path/to/install/location

- Create downstream with new local packages repo:
  $0 -p new

- Create downstream using upstream's packages repo with custom name:
  $0 -p upstream -n my-spack
